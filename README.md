# Brainly

Brainly is a web-app that helps you **save, organize, and visualize your important links, documents, tweets, videos, and more** — all with a responsive interface. You can call it as your second brain.
(It is a basic MERN stack project with a potential to reform into a fully fledged personal tool by integrating with ML and searching capabilities)
